## To PyPi

[PyPI](https://pypi.org), Python Package Index, is a repository of software for the Python programming language.

### Install or Upgrade package

We use [build](https://pypi.org/project/build/) to build package, and [twine](https://pypi.org/project/twine/) to
upload package to PyPi. You could first install and upgrade them by:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip build twine
```

It is highly recommended [releasing package to TestPyPi](#release-to-testpypi) first, to check whether the
package is correct, and then [release to PyPi](#release-to-pypi).

### Release to TestPyPi

TestPyPi is a test environment of PyPi, you could release to it to test whether the package is work or not.

1. Create an account in [TestPyPi](https://test.pypi.org/account/register/).
2. Clean unrelated files in `dist` directory, and build package `python3 setup.py pre_clean`.
3. Build package `python3 -m build`, and you will see two new files in `dist` directory, with extension
   `.tar.gz` and `.whl`.
4. Upload to TestPyPi `python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*`.
5. Check the package in [TestPyPi](https://test.pypi.org/project/apache-dolphinscheduler/) and install it
   by `python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps apache-dolphinscheduler` to
   test whether it is work or not.

### Release to PyPi
